# AgentOS Community

This repository is the hub of the AgentOS community—open-source plugins, components, apps, and agent configs for [AgentOS](https://github.com/jcontini/agentOS-core).

## What is AgentOS?

**AgentOS is the semantic layer between AI assistants and your digital life.**

Your tasks are in Todoist. Your calendar is in Google. Your messages are split across iMessage, WhatsApp, Slack. Your files are everywhere. Each service is a walled garden—they don't talk to each other, and switching is painful.

**AgentOS fixes this.** It gives AI assistants a unified way to access all your services through a universal language. Your AI can manage tasks, read your calendar, send messages, and search the web—all through one interface, regardless of which service you use.

### The Vision

**You should own your digital life.** Not rent it. Not have it held hostage. Own it.

AgentOS creates a universal entity model—tasks, events, contacts, messages, files—that works across all services. A Todoist plugin maps Todoist's API to the universal `task` entity. A Linear plugin does the same. From your AI's perspective, they're identical: `task.list()`, `task.create()`, `task.complete()`.

This means:
- **Migration is trivial** — Switch from Todoist to Linear? Same entity, different backend
- **Cross-service queries work** — "Show tasks due today from all sources"
- **AI understands everything** — One schema, not 50 proprietary formats
- **You're in control** — Your data, your computer, your rules

### What You Can Do

- **Let AI manage your tasks** — "Create a task to review the PR" → Done
- **Cross-service queries** — "What did I discuss with Sarah last week?" → Searches messages, emails, calendar
- **Unified calendar** — See events from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook in one place
- **Smart workflows** — "Every morning, summarize unread emails and add tasks for action items"
- **Easy migration** — Switch from Todoist to Linear without losing data or relationships

### For Everyone

**You don't need to be technical to use AgentOS.** Enable plugins, connect your services, and your AI assistants can use them. The community builds the plugins—you just use them.

**You don't need to code to contribute.** Found a bug? Want a new plugin? Have an idea? Open an issue. The community is here to help.

## For Developers

### Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcontini/agentos-community
cd agentos-community
npm install    # Sets up pre-commit hooks
```

### Testing

**Validation** (schema + test coverage):
```bash
npm run validate              # Check all plugins
```

**Functional tests** (actual API calls):
```bash
npm test                      # Run all tests (excludes .needs-work)
npm run test:needs-work       # Test plugins in .needs-work
npm test plugins/exa/tests    # Test specific plugin
```

**Test structure:** Tests are organized by domain (`tests/plugins/`, `tests/entities/`). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#testing) for details.

**The `.needs-work` folder:** Plugins that fail validation are automatically moved to `plugins/.needs-work/` to keep the main directory clean.

See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** for plugin development, testing, and contribution terms.

description: Access macOS Calendar and Contacts via native APIs
icon: icon.png
color: "#000000"

website: https://www.apple.com/macos/
platform: macos

# No auth block = no credentials needed (local system access)
# Uses macOS permissions: Calendar, Contacts

instructions: |
  Apple provider accesses local macOS Calendar and Contacts.
  
  **Requirements:**
  - macOS only
  - Grant permissions in System Settings → Privacy & Security:
    - Calendars → Full Access for Cursor/Terminal
    - Contacts → Allow access for Cursor/Terminal
  
  **Calendar notes:**
  - All calendars configured in macOS Calendar.app are accessible (iCloud, Google, etc.)
  - Subscribed calendars (ICS feeds like US Holidays) are read-only
  - Recurring events: updates/deletes only affect the single occurrence
  - Times use system timezone
  
  **Contacts notes:**
  - Contact IDs can change after iCloud sync - query by name after create
  - Phone numbers are auto-normalized: 5125551234 → +15125551234
  - URL labels are auto-detected: github.com → "GitHub"

# Apple

Access macOS Calendar and Contacts via native APIs.

## Requirements

- **macOS only**
- **Permissions required** in System Settings → Privacy & Security:
  - Calendars → Full Access
  - Contacts → Allow

### Granting Permissions

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
2. Click **Calendars** (or **Contacts**)
3. Enable access for the app (Cursor, Terminal, etc.)
4. Restart the app if needed

## Tools

| Tool | Implementation | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Calendar | EventKit (Swift binary) | Full CRUD, attendees, recurrence |
| Contacts | SQL reads + AppleScript writes | Full CRUD, photos |

## Why This Architecture?

### Calendar: EventKit

AppleScript calendar access is limited:
- Can't handle async permission prompts (macOS 14+)
- Recurrence rules are difficult to parse
- No attendee access
- Slow for large calendars

EventKit provides full access via a compiled Swift helper binary.

### Contacts: AppleScript

The Contacts framework (`CNContact`) has known bugs:
- `mutableCopy()` doesn't preserve notes
- Social profiles get corrupted
- Unreliable iCloud sync

AppleScript is Apple's canonical interface - changes sync reliably with iCloud.
SQLite is used for reads (fast, indexed) while AppleScript handles writes.

## Calendar Features

- List events with date range, calendar filter, search
- Get event details including attendees and recurrence
- Create events (timed or all-day)
- Update events (title, time, location, calendar)
- Delete events
- List all calendars

## Contacts Features

- Search/list contacts
- Get full contact details (all phones, emails, URLs)
- Create contacts with auto-normalization
- Update contact fields
- Delete contacts

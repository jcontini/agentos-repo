# Browser

**⚡ Always start with `inspect`** — it's fast, cheap, and gives you everything: page structure, buttons, inputs, console logs, network requests.

## Quick Start

```
tool: inspect
params: {url: "https://example.com"}
```

This returns structured data in seconds. Only use other tools after inspecting.

## Tool Priority

| Priority | Tool | Use when |
|----------|------|----------|
| 1️⃣ | `inspect` | **Always start here** — page overview, console, network |
| 2️⃣ | `console` | Focus on JavaScript errors |
| 2️⃣ | `network` | Focus on failed API calls |
| 3️⃣ | `click` / `type` | Interact with elements |
| 3️⃣ | `get_text` | Extract specific content |
| 4️⃣ | `evaluate` | Run custom JavaScript |
| ⚠️ | `get_html` | Full HTML (can timeout on heavy pages) |
| ⚠️ | `screenshot` | Visual capture (expensive tokens) |

## Tools

### inspect ⚡ (start here)
Page structure, buttons, inputs, console logs, network activity.

```
tool: inspect
params: {url: "https://example.com"}
```

### console
JavaScript console logs and errors.

```
tool: console
params: {url: "https://example.com"}
```

### network
Network requests and failed API calls.

```
tool: network
params: {url: "https://example.com"}
```

### click
Click an element. Returns any console/network errors.

```
tool: click
params: {url: "https://example.com", selector: "text=Submit"}
```

### type
Type into an input field.

```
tool: type
params: {url: "https://example.com", selector: "input[name='email']", text: "hello@example.com"}
```

### get_text
Extract text from elements.

```
tool: get_text
params: {url: "https://example.com", selector: "h1"}
```

### evaluate
Run JavaScript in the page context.

```
tool: evaluate
params: {url: "https://example.com", script: "document.title"}
```

### get_html ⚠️
Full HTML (can timeout on heavy pages — prefer inspect).

```
tool: get_html
params: {url: "https://example.com", selector: "main"}
```

### screenshot ⚠️
Capture screenshot (expensive in tokens — use sparingly).

```
tool: screenshot
params: {url: "https://example.com"}
```

## CSS Selectors

- `text=Click me` — Element containing text
- `#id` — By ID
- `.class` — By class
- `button` — By tag
- `[data-testid="submit"]` — By attribute
